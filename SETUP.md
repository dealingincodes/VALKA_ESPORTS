# ðŸŽ® BMCS CHALLENGER SERIES 2025 - Setup Guide

## ðŸ“§ Email Configuration Setup

To enable the registration form email functionality, follow these steps:

### 1. Gmail App Password Setup

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Navigate to Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
   - Enter a name like "BMCS Registration Form"
   - Copy the generated 16-character password

### 2. Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with your actual credentials:

```bash
EMAIL_USER=your-actual-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
```

**Important**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control!

### 3. Test the Registration Form

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Click the "Register Now" button
3. Fill out the form with test data
4. Submit and check your email

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid login" error**: Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular Gmail password
2. **"Less secure app access" error**: Enable 2FA and use App Passwords instead
3. **Form not submitting**: Check browser console for errors and ensure API route is working

### Email Not Receiving?
